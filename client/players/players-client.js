/*
 * No tests attached!
 *
 * This module is calling external resources by using standard and/or 3rd party libaries.
 * It's not our code and should not be tested on unit level!!!
 * That has probably (or hopefully?) already been done by the authors of this code that we've chosen to trust.
 *
 * Instead, we break the code out into this minimal module and rely on e2e and manual tests
 * with mocked and/or real implentations.
 *
 * A common mistake is to start mocking these libaries by stubbing or using a mocking framework such
 * as Sinon or similar. However, that's almost always a big mistake. More often than not, it adds to much
 * cognitive load on your brain to be worth the effort. On top of that, it often leads to unmaintainable code.
 * Don't fall into that trap!
 *
 * Develop the code in the node repl or in the browser. Then copy/paste. Let the e2e tests verify it works 
 * on the build server.
