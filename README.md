## Day 4 

### Roster
You are going to implement a new page, `players.html`, in the app with a roster listing all the players.

### API
You will create a backend service with an API that lists all players. 
Today, you will create a mocked version that will be used during development. (You will create the real implementation tomorrow)

### Client
To fetch the data and populate the html page, you have to create a javascript client. Use `fetch` to make the HTTP request.
Remember that you have to pack the client side JavaScript (create release) before running the app. 


### Tests
Let the tests, and the hints you find in the code, guide you. When all tests pass, you should have a working solution.

#### Bonus Exercise
If you finish the exercise above and don't have anything to do, you may try to implement paging on the roster page.
Paging is a bonus feature, so implement it in a separate branch based on your working branch.

Do it in such way that you can cherry pick the paging functionality into tomorrows exercise which do not contain any paging functionality. 
This is also a good strategy if you begin to implement paging, but don't have the time to finish. 
You may get more slack time before this app is finished where you can continue with this bonus exercise.
