## Day 4 

### Roster
You are going to implement a new page, `players.html`, in the app with a roster listing all the players.

### API
You will create a backend service with an API that lists all players. 
Today, you will create a mocked version that will be used during development. (You will create the real implementation tomorrow)

### Client
To fetch the data and populate the html page, you have to create a javascript client. Use `fetch` to make the HTTP request.
Remember that you have to pack the client side JavaScript (create release) before running the app. 


### Tests
Let the tests, and the hints you find in the code, guide you. When all tests pass, you should have a working solution.
