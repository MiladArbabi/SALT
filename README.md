## Day 6

Add a _team_ to your players. 

### API
The team is represented by where the player origins from in SWAPI. It has already been implemented in the mock api, but you have to dig out the data from SWAPI.

### UI
When your API contains team data, you also have to add it to the UI layer. When the user expands the details about a player, it should also contain team data.

_As always - let the tests guide you!_

#### Bonus Exercise
If you finish the exercise above and don't have anything to do, you may try to implement pagination on the roster page.
Pagination is a bonus feature, so implement it in a separate branch based on your working branch.

Do it in such way that you can cherry pick the pagination functionality into tomorrows exercise which do not contain any pagination functionality. 
This is also a good strategy if you begin to implement paging, but don't have the time to finish. 
You may get more slack time before this app is finished where you can continue with this bonus exercise.
