## Day 6

Add a _team_ to your players. 

### API
The team is represented by where the player origins from in SWAPI. It has already been implemented in the mock api, but you have to dig out the data from SWAPI.

### UI
When your API contains team data, you also have to add it to the UI layer. When the user expands the details about a player, it should also contain team data.

_As always - let the tests guide you!_
